On the cargo ot tacker dash....



We want to add a new feature to the Truck Owner dashboard called Pricing Model. The purpose of this feature is to let truck owners define how they charge for trips, so the system can automatically calculate prices for cargo movers.

What the Truck Owner Needs to Do

They will see a new menu item called Pricing Model.

When they open it, they will choose one of two ways they want to charge:

Price per Kilometer

Price per Ton (weight)

After choosing one option, they will enter their rate.

The app saves that rate so it can be used for future trip requests.

What the Cargo Mover Will Experience

When a cargo mover is creating a trip request, the system will automatically check how the selected truck owner charges.

The system will then automatically calculate the price based on:

The distance of the trip (if the owner charges per kilometer), or

The weight of the cargo (if the owner charges per ton)

The cargo mover will see the final calculated price before confirming the trip.

What Our System Needs to Do

Allow the truck owner to set their preferred pricing method.

Store that information so it’s always available.

When a trip request is made, use the stored pricing method and rate to calculate the cost automatically.

Show this cost to the cargo mover and save it as part of the trip details.
