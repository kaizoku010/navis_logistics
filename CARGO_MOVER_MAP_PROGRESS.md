# Cargo-Mover and Truck Owner Dashboard Map Features Progress Summary

## Original Goal:
1.  **Cargo-Mover Dashboard Map:** Display the real-time location of deliveries until they are delivered.
2.  **Truck Owner Dashboard Map:** Track their trucks and drivers in real-time.

## Progress on Cargo-Mover Dashboard Map:

### What was attempted:
The goal was to transition the Cargo-Mover dashboard map to display real-time delivery and driver locations using Firestore listeners, replacing the one-time API fetches.

### What was done so far:
1.  **`src/contexts/CargoMoverDeliveryContext.js` created:** This new context was implemented to provide real-time updates for deliveries belonging to the Cargo-Mover's company. It sets up a Firestore `onSnapshot` listener, filtering deliveries by `user.company`.
2.  **`src/contexts/CargoMoverDriverContext.js` created:** This new context was implemented to provide real-time updates for drivers belonging to the Cargo-Mover's company. It sets up a Firestore `onSnapshot` listener, filtering drivers by `user.company`.
3.  **`src/index.js` updated:** The `CargoMoverDash` component in the router configuration was successfully wrapped with `CargoMoverDeliveryProvider` and `CargoMoverDriverProvider` to make the new contexts available.

### What failed:
*   Attempts to modify `src/pages/CargoMoverDash.js` to integrate these new contexts and uncomment the map component failed due to `old_string` mismatches in the `replace` tool operations. This prevented the exact integration of the new contexts and the map display.

### What's remaining for Cargo-Mover Dashboard Map:
*   **Complete the integration in `src/pages/CargoMoverDash.js`:**
    *   Import `useCargoMoverDeliveries()` and `useCargoMoverDrivers()`.
    *   Consume the `companyDeliveries`, `loadingCompanyDeliveries`, `companyDrivers`, and `loadingCompanyDrivers` from these new contexts.
    *   Remove the old `deliveries`, `drivers`, `fetchDeliveriesFromAPI()`, and `fetchDriversFromAPI()` from `useDatabase()` destructuring and the initial `useEffect`.
    *   Uncomment the `NewMap` component.
    *   Update the `cargoMoverDeliveries`, `activeDeliveries`, and `driverLocations` calculations to use the real-time data from `companyDeliveries` and `companyDrivers`.
    *   Add appropriate loading state handling (e.g., `CircularProgress`) using `loadingCompanyDeliveries` and `loadingCompanyDrivers`.

## Progress on Truck Owner Dashboard Map:

### What was attempted:
(No specific attempts yet, as we focused on the Cargo-Mover dashboard first.)

### What was done so far:
(None)

### What failed:
(None)

### What's remaining for Truck Owner Dashboard Map:
*   **Implement real-time tracking for trucks and drivers:** This will involve a similar approach to the Cargo-Mover dashboard, likely requiring new contexts for real-time truck and driver data relevant to the Truck Owner, and integration into the `TruckerDash.js` component.

We can pick this up tomorrow.
